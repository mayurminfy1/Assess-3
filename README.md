# Assignment 3: Branching Strategies & Merge Conflicts

## Objective
This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Flow by working with branches, making changes, and resolving merge conflicts.

## Project Overview
A simple web page or script illustrating the process of:
- Creating feature branches
- Making conflicting changes
- Handling and resolving merge conflicts
- Successfully merging updates

## Branching Strategy
The repository follows GitHub Flow:
1. Created feature branches from `main`:
   - `feature/update-styling`: Modified styling or formatting.
   - `feature/add-content`: Added new content.
2. Made commits modifying the same files in different ways.
3. Opened pull requests for both branches.
4. Merged `feature/update-styling` first.
5. Encountered and resolved merge conflicts when merging `feature/add-content`.
6. Successfully merged all changes.

## Merge Conflict Resolution
A conflict occurred when merging `feature/add-content` into `main` due to overlapping file modifications. Steps taken to resolve:
1. GitHub identified conflicting sections.
2. Manually edited the files to integrate both sets of changes.
3. Removed conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
4. Verified functionality after resolving conflicts.
5. Committed the final changes.
6. Completed the merge.
